	<h1>30 Days of Web Dev: Liz Krane's April 2015 challenge</h1>
	<p>I'm learning about web development by creating a website or web app every day for 30 days. Wish me luck! I'll link to everything I make on this page as I continue learning. (I'll also make this page prettier later on.) You can see all the code at <a href="https://github.com/LearningNerd/30DaysOfWebDev">https://github.com/LearningNerd/30DaysOfWebDev</a>.</p>
