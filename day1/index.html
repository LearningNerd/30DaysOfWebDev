title: Liz's Awesome First GitHub Pages Website
---
		<h1>Hello! This is Liz's awesome first GitHub Pages site.</h1>
		<p>I'm learning about web development by creating a website or web app every day for 30 days. Wish me luck! You can <a href="../">see all my daily projects here</a>.</p>
		<p>I built this GitHub site by following <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">this tutorial by Jonathan McGlone</a> and <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/">this tutorial by Anna Debenham</a>.
		<p>Also, here are some dancing robots!  I stole them from <a href="http://codepen.io/c4rin3/pen/Gsfmu">here</a>. Like <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/">many people have said</a>, "Good artists copy; great artists steal."</p>
